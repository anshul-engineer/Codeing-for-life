#Given n doors and n persons. The doors are numbered 1 to n and persons are given id’s numbered 1 to n. Each door can have only 2 status open and closed. Initially all the doors have status closed. Find the final status of all the doors if a person changes the current status of all the doors, i.e. if status open then change to status closed and vice versa, for which he is authorized. A person with id ‘i’ is authorized to change the status of door numbered ‘j’ if ‘j’ is a multiple of ‘i’.

#Note:
#– A person has to change the current status of all the doors for which he is authorized exactly once.
#– There can be a situation that before a person changes the status of the door, another person who is also authorized for the same door changes the status of the door.
